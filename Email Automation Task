This project is designed to automatically classify emails into different categories based on their content. The model currently detects and tags emails as one of the following types:

📬 General

🗣️ Feedback

❓ Enquiry

🔍 Objective
The goal is to streamline inbox management by using machine learning to sectionalize emails by intent, helping users quickly identify and respond to messages based on their type.

🧠 How It Works
Data Collection
Sample emails are gathered and labeled into the three main categories: General, Feedback, and Enquiry.

Preprocessing

Text cleaning (removal of punctuation, stopwords, etc.)

Tokenization and vectorization

Model Training
A machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or BERT) is trained on the labeled dataset.

Prediction
Given any new email, the model predicts whether it falls into one of the three categories.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python

Scikit-learn / NLTK / SpaCy

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

(Optional) Streamlit for frontend demo

🚀 Future Improvements
Add more granular email types (e.g., Complaints, Support Requests)

Use Transformer-based models (like BERT) for improved accuracy

Integrate with Gmail/Outlook via API for real-time email classification

Dashboard for visualizing classified emails

🧪 How to Use
